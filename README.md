haaper (håper)
======

Convert Hebrew between standard Unicode UTF-8 encoding and Tiqwah* ASCII representation, also phonetic SAMPA IPA

Håper is Norwegian for 'hope,' equivalent to Hebrew tiqwah.

* Tiqwah is an encoding developed by Yannis Haralambous for LaTeX editing of scholarly versions of ancient Hebrew and Aramaic documents. This is not yet a complete implementation, but it covers most characters for a Bible text. Also, the three letter codes for teamim and other symbols are surrounded by curly braces {} instead of angle brackets &lt;&gt; for use in HTML/XML.
